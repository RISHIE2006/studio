- Accent color: Hopeful green (#76D7C4), highlighting interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean, calm, and highly readable text, suitable for critical information delivery in stressful situations.
- Minimalist icons representing key features. For example, a heart icon for medical assistance, a pill icon for the medicine locator and so on.
- Minimalist design prioritizing clarity and ease of use. Clear visual hierarchy directing users to immediate help options.
- Subtle 3D animations on the homepage (highway scene). Microinteractions on buttons and loading screens. An ambulance driving indicates the action of searching for help.
